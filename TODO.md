# To Do

- Fetch a list of charities from Just-Giving endpoing (https://www.justgiving.com/search/query?countrySelected=true&g=true&i=charity&limit=20&offset=20&q=+&type=)
- See if it's possible to publicly donate to Just Giving and pull the information for all of those past donations into the extension
- Allow the user to set the miner throttling
- Come up with a name (Project Badger isn't acceptable)
- Add an About page that explains how it works (maybe link to standaloen website for that?)
- Build a product website!
